                            <p class="lead">
                                <strong>Abstract</strong>: Our daily life is facilitated by the many software, and hardware, that are supporting most of human activities.
                                However, there is not a single day without news reporting a major failure somewhere in the world, not even counting the
                                small glitches still affecting us too often. To prevent that, software testing is the main approach for eliminating as
                                many defects as possible in software before releasing it. The role of software testing is thus to find defects, typically
                                to detect bugs. The complementary role of diagnosis, fault localization and repair, is to fix them. These two activities
                                are traditionally distinct, and are usually assigned to different teams. This situation has deeply influenced the development
                                processes, and in particular the more recent DevOps processes based on continuous integration, like the ones deployed by
                                large software companies such as Google. In this presentation, we motivate the importance of testing for improving reliability
                                and security, we analyse the Google DevOps process in this respect, and ultimately we revisit the recent advances in automated
                                program repair to foresee a future in which the continuous integration loop would be inverted, in which bugs would be
                                preventively removed before any test is run.

                    <p class="lead">
                        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Machine-learning-based anomaly detection systems can be vulnerable to new kinds of deceptions, known as training attacks, which exploit the live learning mechanism of these systems by progressively injecting small portions of abnormal data. The injected data seamlessly swift the learned states to a point where harmful data can pass unnoticed. This talk focuses on the systematic testing of these attacks in the context of intrusion detection systems (IDS). We propose a search-based approach to test IDS by making training attacks. Going a step further, we also propose searching for countermeasures, learning from the successful attacks and thereby increasing the resilience of the tested IDS. We evaluate our approach on a denial-of-service attack detection scenario and a dataset recording the network traffic of a real-world system. Our experiments show that our search-based attack scheme generates successful attacks bypassing the current state-of-the-art defences. We also show that our approach is capable of generating attack patterns for all configuration states of the studied IDS and that it is capable of providing appropriate countermeasures. By co-evolving our attack and defence mechanisms we succeeded at improving the defence of the IDS under test by making it resilient to 49 out of 50 independently generated attacks.

                        <p class="lead">
                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> Automatic bug fixing, i.e., the idea of having programs that fix other programs, is a long-standing dream that is
                            increasingly embraced by the software engineering community. Indeed, despite the significant effort that humans put into
                            reviewing code and running software test campaigns, programming mistakes slip by, with severe consequences. Fixing those
                            mistakes automatically has recently been the focus of a number of potentially promising techniques. Proposed approaches
                            are however recurrently criticized as being shallow (i.e., they mostly address unit test failures, which are often neither
                            hard nor important problems). We discuss the challenges in state of the art program repair pipelines to highlight the fundamental
                            issues that prevent existing tools to be applied industry. We also discuss our recent contributions towards improving the
                            practicality of program repair.

                        <p class="lead">
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Mutation testing realises the idea of using artificial defects to support testing activities. 
                            Mutation is typically used as a way to evaluate the adequacy of test suites, to guide the generation of 
                            test cases and to support experimentation. Mutation has reached a maturity phase and gradually gains popularity 
                            both in academia and in industry. This talk will survey the advances related to the fundamental problems of 
                            mutation testing and will set out the challenges and open problems for the future development of the method.

                        <p class="lead">
                            <strong>Abstract:</strong> These last 10 years, mobile devices, such as smart phones, have spread at an exponential rate. 
                            The most used system running on these devices, accounting for almost 80% of market share for smart phones 
                            world-wide, is the Android software stack. The success of Android and the millions of users downloading 
                            every days millions of Android apps make Android a prime target for malware writers. In this talk, I explore 
                            8 years of work aiming at making Android Apps safer and more reliable. First, I present the premise of our 
                            research work in developing Android app analysers in a time where Dalvik bytecode was still an obstacle. 
                            Second, I share our expertise in building a large Android app dataset such as AndroZoo. On top of this dataset, 
                            I present several research works covering (1) Android Malware detection by leveraging Machine Learning techniques, 
                            (2) Malware Labelling for creating better ground truth, and (3) Android App mining to understand usage trends and app dev issues.
